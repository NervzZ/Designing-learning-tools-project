## **How to work with Git:**
1. Create a branch from one of the board's issues (or manually if needed).
2. You can then use `git fetch` to make the new branch visible locally.
3. Checkout to that branch using `git checkout`. To see on which branch you currently are and list available branches, use `git branch`.
4. As you make each change iterations on this branch, proceed as follows:
    * Use `git status` everytime to see what has been changed and is currently added to commit (green) or not (red).
    * Use `git add` followed by the path to the file you want to add to commit. **Note:** You can use wildcards, for example to add all files you can do `git add *`.
    * Once you're done adding what you wanted for your next commit, use `git commit -m {message}` where `{message}` is simply a short description of what has changed with this commit.
    * To push your commits to the branch (both locally and remote) you can now do `git push`.
5. Once you pushed all your changes and you're done with the branch, head over to the repo and make the pull request to merge your changes to `main`. Also consider deleting the branch (also locally) before it gets annoying to nagivate when using `git branch`.

NOTE: Use `git restore {path to file}` to roll-back the changes you made to a file and restore it back to the latest unchanged state known to your branch.<br><br>
   
**Important:**<br>
If the remote branch is more up to date than your local one, you simply do `git pull` to update your local branch. Always do so when needed.<br><br>
If `main` got updated while you were working on a branch not yet finished and for some reason you need the new changes of main, you can use `git rebase main` from your current branch and then `git push --force`.<br>
Be very cautious with doing this and consider asking before attempting it if unsure.
